application using CEF on the Linux platform. Please see the LICENSING
section of this document for licensing terms and conditions.


CONTENTS
--------

cefclient   Contains the cefclient sample application configured to build
            using the files in this distribution. This application demonstrates
            a wide range of CEF functionalities.

cefsimple   Contains the cefsimple sample application configured to build
            using the files in this distribution. This application demonstrates
            the minimal functionality required to create a browser window.

Debug       Contains libcef.so and other components required to run the debug
            version of CEF-based applications. By default these files should be
            placed in the same directory as the executable and will be copied
            there as part of the build process.

include     Contains all required CEF header files.

libcef_dll  Contains the source code for the libcef_dll_wrapper static library
            that all applications using the CEF C++ API must link against.

Release     Contains libcef.so and other components required to run the release
            version of CEF-based applications. By default these files should be
            placed in the same directory as the executable and will be copied
            there as part of the build process.

Resources   Contains resources required by libcef.so. By default these files
            should be placed in the same directory as libcef.so and will be
            copied there as part of the build process.


USAGE
-----

Building using CMake:
  CMake can be used to generate project files in many different formats. See
  usage instructions at the top of the CMakeLists.txt file.

Building using the pre-existing make solution (DEPRECATED):
  Run 'build.sh Debug' to build the cefclient target in Debug mode.

Please visit the CEF Website for additional usage information.

REDISTRIBUTION
--------------

This binary distribution contains the below components. Components listed under
the "required" section must be redistributed with all applications using CEF.
Components listed under the "optional" section may be excluded if the related
features will not be used.

Required components:

* CEF core library
    libcef.so

* Unicode support
    icudtl.dat

Optional components:

  Only configured locales need to be distributed. If no locale is configured the
  default locale of "en-US" will be used. Locale file loading can be disabled
  completely using CefSettings.pack_loading_disabled. The locales folder path
  can be customized using CefSettings.locales_dir_path.

* Other resources
    cef.pak
    cef_100_percent.pak
    cef_200_percent.pak
    devtools_resources.pak
  Note: Contains WebKit image and inspector resources. Pack file loading can be
  disabled completely using CefSettings.pack_loading_disabled. The resources
  directory path can be customized using CefSettings.resources_dir_path.
